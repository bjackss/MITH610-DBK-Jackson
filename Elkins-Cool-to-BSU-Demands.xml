        <p>Foster Hall, BSU treasurer and<lb/>
one of three members who met with<lb/>
Elkins, said they will seek another<lb/>

      </div>

he added.<lb/></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>The other two representatives who
met with Elkins were BSU Pres­
ident Terance Cooper and Chrlss
Young.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>During the 45-minute meeting, all
but three of the demands were dis­
cussed, Hall said. The original list
of demands had been presented Fri­
day to Walter B. Waetjen, vice pres­
ident for administrative affairs.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Elkins began by saying the demand
that he and other members of the
administration resign was non-neg­
otiable, according to Hall.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Some of the demands were be­
yond his authority, Elkins added ac­
cording to a University spokesman,
and if he resigned he ‘‘wouldn’t be
in a position to respond” at all.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
       <p>The president said he had no auth­
ority to Intervene in the Maryland
State College Issue until the school
comes under University jurisdiction
July 1.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>BSU had demanded that the 181
students arrested at the college rec­ently not be penalized for their buil­
ding occupation action and that col­
lege President John T. Williams be
fired.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
<p>Elkins also said he had no in­
fluence with the state to push for
pay raises for campus classified
workers, as BSU had demanded, Hall
said.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
The president answered the demand
for a change In the black studies pro­
gram to Include black community-ori­
ented projects by saying the Uni­
versity "does not have the capabil­
ity or presently the faculty to ex­
tend itself” Into the community.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Hall noted that the increase in funds
for black studies, which Elkins said
would be proportional to the Increase
In the entire budget, was not accept­
able to BSU members.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
<p>To the demand that classes be pro­
vided for residents of nearby Lake­
land, Elkins responded that classes
are both possible and probable.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
<p>He said he would talk to faculty
about It and requested BSU to draw
up a plan for using the adult edu­
cation center for the classes.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Hall said that plan and another
one for including the children of
campus service workers in the Uni­
versity kindergarten program would
be submitted today.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
<p>Elkins had Informed the BSU rep­
resentatives at the meeting that the
kindergarten was open to all campus
employes.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
<p>The demand that recruiting of black
students and faculty be stepped up
was answered with a statement by El­
kins that the present program was
sufficient.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
<p>Hall contended, however, that the
number of blacks has not Increased
substantially, although he said he
would not have the exact figures un­
til today.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
<p>one of the demands, that amnesty
be granted to three black students
who were arested after a fight In
College Park recently, had been
turned over to J. Winston Martin,
vice president for student affairs,
for Investigation shortly after the
Incident happened.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
<p>Elkins noted that the University
does not have jurisdiction In such
off-campus cases.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
<p>Hall mentioned, however, that he
has not heard from Martin since
sometime before Easter vacation.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
<p>Regarding another demand, Elkins
said it would be “illegal” to reor­
ganize the University structure to
place control in the hands of students,
faculty and chosen administrators.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
<p>He said, however, that as soon as
a human relations director is appoin­
ted, students could take their ideas
for change to him. The director will
be the vice chancellor, Elkins said.
Both the director and the chancel­
lor have yet to be appointed.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
<p>The demand for free legal counsel
for black students “made to suffer
as a result of their political activ­
ity” was satisfied when Student Gov­
ernment President Stu Robinson of­
fered the use of the SGA legal aid
fund, which does not come from state
funds, Hall said.</p>
