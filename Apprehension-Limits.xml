          <p>What is it like to be a Negro
          student on a white campus? Each
          Negro student has his own per­sonal opinion.
          •There’s no difference, “main­
          tained one sophomore, “Negro is
          just a legal term the white man
          made up for convenience."
          “No, our culture is different,"
          projected a dark-skinned boy.
          •It’s composed of James Brown
          and the Supremes."
          •They stare at me in class when
          we discuss slavery or Africa,"
          noted one young girl. “I guess
          it’s out of curiosity."
          •People yell out of car windows
          at me," put in an adamant coed,
          cursing the University under her
          breath. This was Doris, a dis­
          satisfied Negro, bitter towards
          her four years at the University.
          Doris sells Black power but­
          tons, “a quarter for Negroes, a
          dollar for whites."</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>•You can’t write an article on
        Negroes," she told this reporter.
        •Anything you write, white people
        will think is interesting. . .but to
        colored people it won’t mean a
        thing."
        Only colored people know and
        understand colored people, she
        maintains. This seems to be
        true, for the white student cannot
        find a typical Negro student from
        which to generalize about the
        200-400 colored undergraduates
        on campus.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>The Negroes compose a hete­
        rogeneous population, demarca
        ed from the rest of the student
        body by skin color and/or a few
        tables in the Main Dining Hall
        or the Student Union. The Negro
        students’ views are varied, their
        experiences largely dissimilar,
        and even their skin topes are of
        different shades.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>This is an article about the
        Negro students in the Union. They
        comprise an amorphous group of
        between 40-50 students who gath­
        er in the cafeteria every after­
        noon to eat, “shoot the breeze”
        and play pinochle.
        Who are they? How do they
        mingle with white students? These
        are glimpses of the experiences
        they relate as they sip Cokes
        and munch on pizza between
        classes.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Social events is a major topic
          these students discuss when
          viewing their interaction with
          whites.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>“At dorm deserts, I don’t really
        fit in,” said Gary, a cool College
        Joe who talks fast and smiles a
        lot. “They don’t play our kind of
        music.”</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>“At one desert,” he continued
          wryly, “I asked a white girl to
          dance. She refused me, so I sat
          down,”</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Later, he noticed the girl danc­
          ing with white boys. He went over
          to her and asked her for the next
          record.”</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>“Her girl friends were pushing
          her to dance with me,” he re­called. “So she did. We danced,
          and in the middle of the record
          she burst into tears and ran to
          her housemother.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Deducing a moral from his
          story, Gary declared, “I don't
          care if they don’t want to dance
          with me, I just wish that before
          each desert they’d make a list of
          girls who won’t dance with me so
          m know."</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>At summer orientation last
          July, she explained, she was the
          only Negro in her tour group.
          •They were surprised, I guess,
          to see a Negro. They said
          nothing against me, but they
          stared as if they didn’t expect
          to see a Negro in their group."
          “I used to live in Philadelphia,"
          Donna continued. "I was in the
          minority. . .so I got used to the
          feeling of being the only one there
          and people staring."</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>But this feeling is "kind of
          lonely," and that was why Donna
          “declined living on campus--be­
          cause of summer orientation.*
          •I haven’t had any problems
          with any students in class," she
          continued. “They even come to
          me and ask me for help. They
          don’t judge you by your color, but
          by what you can do." But Donna
          still prefers to live at home,
          rather than on campus.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Another commuter, Alphonso,
          was part of a nucleus of Negro
          students who tried to establish
          a “bi-racial" fraternity on cam­
          pus last spring. Plans were made
          to establish Omega Psi Phi, but
          due to a start late in the semes­
          ter, the group was unable to
          start a chapter.</p>
        </div>

      <div type="subtitle"><p>Meeting ‘awkward’</p></div>

      <div>
        <p>“Many people who wanted to
      become charter members com­
      muted from Baltimore," Alphonso
      explained. It was “awkward for
      them to come back for a meeting
      at night." Also, a set sum of
      money had to be laid down within
      a one-week time limit. Gary
      feels that this payment deadline
      prevented the group from gen­
      erating more immediate interest.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Dwayne, a commuter who
      spends part of each afternoon in
      the Union improving his game of
      pinochle, explained why he would
      like to establish a fraternity.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>“Everybody likes to have some -
      thing when they graduate, a group
      to call back together, a group to
      talk up old times. It’s good to
      be able to come back and look
      at the work you have done."</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>He and Alphonso also note
      that a fraternity would give the
      Negro students a chance to par­
      ticipate in Homecoming, to com­
      pete in athletic events, and to
      gain a voice in campus affairs.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Other Negroes disagree. They
      see little unity in a “bi-racial*
      fraternity, they anticipate that
      Negroes would remain together,
      and this would not alter signifi­cantly their present rate of in­
      teraction with whites.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Another student added that
      although Negroes have been
      “shunner" from “going into fra­ternities, “I would not join a
      fraternity simply (only) because
      it was black."</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>None of the 24 social frater­nities on campus are racially
      integrated with whites and Ne­
      groes. The fraternities have
      no discriminatory clauses in
      their charters, but attitudinal
      barriers and apprehensive feel­ings seem to bar a Negro from
      pledging a white house.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>These feelings are not fostered
      by white students alone. Negroes
      find they are reluctant to rush
      a white fraternity. They doubt
      that they would be pledged, and
      if they were, they wonder if they
      could be accepted as a brother.
      Also, at parties, could the Ne­
      groes bring white dates without
      offending or shocking the alumni
      and brothers?</p>
      </div>

      <div type="subtitle"><p>Interdating</p></div>

      <div>
        <p>These Negroes do interdate.
        They state that white girls are
        generally more friendly toward
        their race than white boys.
        White people, they note, seem
        very concerned with pressures
        exerted by their friends. Negro
        boys dating white coeds have been
        told that when their dates return
        to the dormitory, every one in
        the hall flocks around them to
        ask questions.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>If a Negro mixes socially with
      whites, however, peer-group re­
      action is minimal. Explained
      Gary, “If you’re in the group,
      you’re in. . . We don’t care. . .
      You do what you want to do."</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>White girls, they note, expect
      Negro boys to be fast on a date.
      They are surprised when they
      find Negro behavior to the con­trary. According to several
      Negro boys, colored girls are
      “a lot more shy than white girls."
      “They don’t do things in pub­
      lic," explained one boy. “On the
      Mall, I’ve seen things Negro girls
      won’t do."</p>
      </div>

      <div type="subtitle"><p>Sorority obstacle</p></div>

      <div>
        <p>One thing Negro girls can’t do,
      it seems, is join a sorority.
      Last year, two Negro girls went
      through fall sorority rush. One
      girl received no invitations to
      the second round of parties, but
      the other girl was invited back
      to several houses. However,
      after this second group of par­ties, that girl was dropped too.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>This year another girl, Sharon,
      signed up for rush. Cute, petite
      and well-dressed, Sharon said
      she went through rush because
      she had taken it for granted that
      “you go to college, and you join
      a sorority."</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>“I was disappointed not to see
      some Negroes in the sororities,"
      she said. “Out of 18 sororities,
      you would expect to see one. I
      was shocked. Especially on a
      campus this size. Rush was sup­posed to be so open and all,"</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>During rush, she reports,
      “everybody was nice." After open
      house she was Invited back to ten
      houses. But for “set of four"
      parties, she received no return
      bids.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Negroes may join the service
      fraternity and sorority on cam­
      pus. Of the students interviewed,
      one was a member of Gamma Sig­
      ma Sigma sorority. Others were
      members of the marching band,
      P.E Majors Club, the football
      team, and the chess club.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>A perusal through Terrapin
      yearbooks shows that other
      colored students are in Univer­
      sity Theater productions, publi­cations staffs, ROTC groups, the
      Nursing Club, the M Club and the
      Pharmacy Club.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>But even in these groups, there
      are only one or two Negro mem­bers. The low proportion of
      Negro students on campus is not
      the lone factor preventing large
      Negro participation in campus
      activities.</p>
      </div>

        <div>
        <p>The Negroes in the union
      •group* feel that a veil of ap­prehension limits Negro-white
      interaction outside of class. This
      cloak of apprehension is the last
      barrier for a Negro student to
      overcome before he will vie for
      acceptance in an all-white group.
      This cloak of apprehension is
      the last barrier that a white
      person must overcome before he
      will forget color, disregard nega­tive peer-group reactions and
      boldly sit down at a Negro table
      in the Union.</p>
