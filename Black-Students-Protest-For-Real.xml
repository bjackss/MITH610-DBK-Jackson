      <div>
        <p>About 200 black brothers staged a
protest rally in front of the home eco­
nomics building Wednesday. Also pre­
sent were about 100 white sympathizers.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>This rally, unlike past rallies had one
important factor. There was a strong
sincerity in the sisters and brothers
to rid themselves of the problem of
discrimination. Often there were black
sisters standing with emotion filling
their faces, telling it like it is. Brothers
were speaking with hard feeling words.
They often yelled out at the adminis­
tration telling them to cut out the bull
and get to the nitty gritty.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>University administrator J. Winston
standing on the home economics
steps looked just like Dennis the Men­
ance's father after finding out his son had
done an Injustice to a neighbor. I feel
that Martin really wanted to help but
like his friend Robert A, Beach, he knew
nothing could be done.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Beach was called from among the
spectators to the witness stand but upon
arriving, declined to answer any ques­
tions for fear of incriminating himself.
He kept staring at that big administra­
tion building in the foreground of the
steps as if he was under some mystical
power.</p>
      </div>
The black students constantly asked
the two men what were they going to
do about a program that proved to be
based on discrimination. Neither could
answer although Martin made more at­
tempts than Beach. The black students
finally gave up on Beach and continued
to confront Martin.
It must be understood here and now
that the black students want answers
to these demands. It is clear that Martin
and Beach cannot supply them. When
the blacks asked where Elkins was and
demanded that he come out to the rally,
Martin stood confused and Beach looked
stupid.
Our president must face reality on this
campus. As one white student put it,
•this campus is like a powder keg and
about to go off." Issues such as these
must be met head on. They ca#t be
handled by a pacifier of the president.
This just won’t work anymore.
Black students have finally gotten
wise to the tactics used by this univer­
sity. We are not going to sit by and n
watch ourselves be made to look like i
fools while the administration sits%ack
and laughs at us. This event is not just
a happening on campus. It is for real
and these questions presented are going
to be answered by someone who has
authority.
Our white brothers showed thl^ad­
ministration that this is not just a one
way process. They threw just as many
questions to the establishment as blacks
did.
Black and white students know change
must come, but the old roots just
sprout. Progress Is not checked at the
student level. The administration is the
one holding progress up.
The old stlU have old ideas but the
young have the new motor.
BSU calls upon Nero Elkins to hear the
cries of the students. He must no longer
place the students in the arena. He must
no longer let the students fight among
themselves.
We ask him to come before us not
semester but now.
The members of BSU are now using
true black power. BSU president Bob
McLeod says “the white student can
support this cause." First he must open
his mind to the fact that blacks are going
to deal with black problems.
The white support must come from
white organizations. This is due to the
fact that whites relate better to whites
and can explain their positions on the
racial situation much more clearly to
their peers than can a black student.
This is how black and white work
together. I ask the white student not
to get confused on this issue. All people
are needed in a struggle such as this --
even Toms and white liberals.</div>
